",content:`One of Shippers Automotive\u2019s customers, for example, assembles truck dashboards. Without kitting, the required materials to make dashboards generally arrive separately as they are channeled off of trucks, into warehouses, and out to the customer\u2019s manufacturing plant. Unpacking and organizing all the parts in the plants takes up valuable time and space.

                With kitting, Shippers Automotive:  `,list:["Pre-packages all the materials that workers in the manufacturing plant need to assemble each individual dashboard, putting them into individual kits. The kits are like Lego sets, just a lot larger and heavier. ","The parts are organized within the kits in sequence. That way, assembly-line workers can pull out each part in order of need without having to unpack everything at once, wasting valuable time and space. (Can Lego beat that?)"]},{heading:"Customized Software that fits Shippers Automotive\u2019s needs  ",content:`A lot of logistics-software companies, especially the large, corporate operations, compel the customer to adapt to their system. SC Codeworks prides itself on customizing software to meet the precise needs of the customer.

            For Shippers Automotive, that means software that sequences the arrival, cataloging, and retrieval of materials needed to assemble the manufacturing kits.   The myriad benefits of SC Codeworks\u2019 software are best summed up with the word that defines any profitable business: efficiency.

        \u201CThat wasn\u2019t an off-the-shelf solution,\u201D Chris Watkins, vice president of operations at Shippers Automotive, said of the bespoke software SC Codeworks built for the company.  
        <br>SC Codeworks, Watkins said, was \u201Cable to customize things for us and understand and adapt to our business needs without having this massive amount of red tape to go through.

Their customer needed the facility up and running in two weeks flat to support an automotive assembly line. No pressure!  
                    <br><br>
                    SC Codeworks rushed experts to the facility and had them coding on-site even as workers were setting up the facility and hauling in the supplies.

                    Crucially, this facility demanded software tailored to an inventory model, as opposed to a license-plate model. In an inventory model, the software only knows the location of specific boxes. For a license-plate model, software has to be able to identify the precise contents of a box, down to the item level.
