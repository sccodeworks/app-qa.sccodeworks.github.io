They boast over <b>3 million feet of warehouse space</b> in multiple locations in both Ohio and Tennessee, as well as in Chicago, Milwaukee, and Los Angeles.  
                  <br>
                  The <b>thriving company</b> provides warehousing, supply-chain innovation, transportation management, e-commerce fulfilment, and retail consolidation. They serve the unique needs of a diverse array of industries, including health and beauty, food and beverage, consumer packaged goods and retail, industrial and automotive, and private equity.  `},{heading:"The challenge:   ",content:" ODW sought a software solution that would help them achieve a trifecta of fundamental goals\u2014<b>improved staff ergonomics, awareness, and safety</b> \u2014 while also: ",list:["Increasing productivity and accuracy ","Reducing costs","Yielding better value for their customers"]},{heading:"The SC Codeworks Solution:  ",content:`SC Codeworks had long provided ODW with its warehouse management system (WMS), the fully- integrated  <b> Codeworks Enterprise. </b>
<br><br>
After consulting with ODW, Codeworks concluded that a <b>voice solution</b> \u2014 voice-activated warehouse management software\u2014would most optimally address the company\u2019s needs.  
<br><br>
This existing WDLS could already handle functions such as labeling and printing. That system just needed to send, receive and interpret the various communications with the voice solution. 
<br><br>
ODW sought a voice solution that: `,list:["Could send, receive and interpret ","Was hands-free, eyes-free and paperless","Could provide real-time updates","Supported their order volume","Had a quick learning curve for implementation","Didn't require middleware"]},{content:`After researching ODW\u2019s potential options, SC Codeworks determined the best choice was the <b>TopVox voice interface</b> from the Netherlands-based company Inther. 
                <br><br>
                \u201CThe Codeworks WMS <b>gave us more flexibility</b> in selecting a vendor, since its standard features include support for voice technology,\u201D said Jon Petticrew, Vice President of Operations at ODW. `},{heading:"The Products: ",content:`TopVox is a <b>voice-activated transactional-level interface,</b> which permits ODW\u2019s staff to <b>centralize control</b> of the warehouse space and <b>maintain robust visibility</b> of their operations. This holds true regardless of whether the staff use the voice-enabled functions.  
                <br><br>
                Codeworks designed a <b>\u201Ctraffic cop\u201D to respond to voice prompts</b> and direct the transactions and responses within ODW\u2019s operations.  
                <br><br>
                The TopVox interface leveraged ODW\u2019s existing warehouse management system from SC Codeworks, which <b>permits voice prompts </b> to: `,list:["Intelligently assign picks ","Direct replenishments","Integrate cycle counting of locations","Confirms the picks with Codeworks Enterprise"]},{content:`Staffers could also intermix their use of the voice-activated prompts with radio frequency\u2013based methods, as well as paper picking. 
          <br>
          Thanks to the WMS, supervisors gained <b>improved transaction data</b> for data mining, including: `,list:["Information about operational tendencies","Performance data","Data for key point indicators, or KPI, reporting"]},{content:"SC Codeworks delivered the product and fully integrated it into ODW\u2019s operations in <b>three months flat.</b>"},{heading:"The Benefit: ",content:` These TopVox solution helped ODW\u2019s leadership\u202Fdetermine how effective their processes were and <b>identified areas for improvement.  </b>

                  Consequently, TopVox allowed the company to:  `,list:["Reduce order cycle times ","Cut staff training time","Become more cost-effective"]},{content:`Most notable was a <b>28% overall increase in productivity,</b> with some functions seeing <b>productivity gains of up to 50%.</b> 
<br><br>
Once TopVox is up and running in one facility, all it takes to <b>expand its use to another account or facility</b> is a few simple updates to the existing WMS account settings.
