In the words of Vice President Matt Walt, the system IDC was using at the time was, in short, \u201Ca piece of junk.\u201D The software was cumbersome, time consuming, and stressful to use.

          "The initial set-up is just <b>lightning fast,</b>\u201D said Walt. \u201CIt\u2019s a very smooth process. We breeze through it."  <br>
          Before Enterprise, IDC used a different WMS that was so clunky, onboarding took two days.
