It can start with a sharp rise in a specific sector in response to sudden change in the environment, such as a major accident or natural disaster like a bridge collapse or a pandemic. Regardless of how it starts, rising costs of materials, goods, and services spreading like wildfire across related, and unrelated, areas of the economy can have a devastating effect on your business.  
    The rising cost of goods and materials drives up the cost of products, which drives up the cost of living, which drives up the cost of labor, which drives up the costs of operations, which drives up the costs of goods and materials. When combined with the rising costs of energy, utilities and equipment, it should be clear to even the most casual observer that unrelated sectors of the economy are still connected and thus related. 
The loss of operating capital to rising costs beyond your control is an \u201Copportunity loss.\u201D The additional money you are spending with no additional benefit is at best lessening your opportunity to invest elsewhere and at worst significantly decreasing your profits. `,image:"assets/images/home/blog23-1.jpg",sections:[{heading:"The Soaring Cost of Warehousing ",content:"Let us look at just one small area of costs and what might be done to stave off the loss of operating capital. The cost of renting industrial properties has surged significantly.

In summary, while rising rent costs and the recent inflationary trends of overall operating costs pose significant challenges, a thoughtful strategy of specific actions and a well-implemented WMS can enhance operational efficiency, reduce expenses, and contribute to maintaining profitability in a competitive landscape. \u{1F31F}",quote1:"To learn more about SC Codework's highly competitive, scalable, customizable, affordable, and fully supported WMS and how it can help your bottom line, reach out today and start a conversation that we know you won\u2019t regret.
