The year 2024 was exemplary for SC Codeworks and our customers. I want to take this opportunity to reflect on the successful things we did together. We accomplished a lot this year, starting with our EDI transformation using Axway, a well-known global API integration tool. This is a strategic partnership for us and our customers as we continue to modernize and innovate our offerings in data migration, data integration, and getting federated data into our Codeworks Enterprise platform. We successfully implemented Codeworks Enterprise B2B SaaS on Microsoft Azure cloud. This will help our customers scale fast and minimize their capital expenditures on infrastructure. The SC Codeworks team also made strides in our new offering Codeworks Analytics platform, which provides data analytics and data visualization to slice, dice, and drill through the data. For our existing customers, we have had several releases rich in features and have introduced Codeworks Hybrid User Interface (UI).

The strategy for SC Codeworks is simple: we want to democratize the decades\u2019 worth of knowledge and expertise that we built in-house. Our product was built by warehouse operators for the warehouse operators. We want to share our thought leadership with the community to be effective and efficient in doing things. SC Codeworks was at several conferences this year, and we will continue to be present and play an active role in the industry. I want to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our employees for their dedication and commitment to innovating our products for the benefit of our customers. Without our employees, we cannot serve our customers. That is the reason why our philosophy at SC Codeworks is always \u201CEmployees first.\u201D I also would like to thank our customers and partners for their invaluable partnership, and I look forward to 2025.
